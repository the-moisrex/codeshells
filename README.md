# codeshells
This project is written tests, benchmarks, researches, fun-things-to-know, and other random things that I wrote through out years.
Of course I don't have most of what I wrote.

All of these projects have been created with the little tool that I wrote called **codeshell**. You can find the [codeshell binary](https://github.com/the-moisrex/linux-dotfiles/blob/master/bin/codeshell) in my [linux-dotfiles](https://github.com/the-moisrex/linux-dotfiles)' bin directory.

You can create new ones with:

```bash
codeshell -t=[template] -n=[name]
```

Replace `[template]` with one of the template directories in [code-templates directory](https://github.com/the-moisrex/linux-dotfiles/tree/master/code-templates).

Replace `[name]` with one of the above directory names or choose a new name to create one in your `~/codeshells/` directory.
